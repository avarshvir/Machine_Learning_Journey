# Machine Learning
Welcome to my Machine Learning repository! Here, I showcase my skills and projects, reflecting my journey from a beginner to an advanced level in machine learning. In this my machine learning journey I started from scratch to advance level.
This Machine Learning repository provides implementation of various machine learning algorithm in practical way such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning and etc.

# Machine Learning
- Machine Learning is defined as "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
- Machine Learning is a branch of AI that develops algorithms by learning the hidden patterns of datasets used it to make predictions on new similar type data, without exlicity programmed for each task.
